User Snippet is a simple Django project designed to provide a reusable code snippet for extending Django's AbstractBaseUser and creating a customizable user authentication system. It showcases how to seamlessly integrate a custom user model (AppUser) with an associated user profile (UserProfile) that automatically creates a profile for each user and generates a unique slug identifier.

Key Features
Custom User Model: Utilizes a custom user model (AppUser) to enhance user authentication and management.

Automatic Profile Creation: A UserProfile model is automatically created for each user upon registration, establishing a one-to-one relationship and avoiding hardcoded references.

Profile Slug Generation: The UserProfile includes an automatically generated unique slug based on the user's email address.

Django Admin Panel: The Django admin panel is customized to manage and display user instances, with a focus on fields like email, staff status, and superuser status.

REST API Endpoints: Provides REST API endpoints for listing users, retrieving a single user, and deleting users.

Optional API Documentation: Utilizes drf_spectacular to generate API documentation for endpoint testing, but functionality can be accessed and tested entirely through the Django admin panel.
